R Code supporting the publication of Travers-Smith et al., (2024). "Mapping vegetation height and identifying the northern forest limit across Canada using ICESat-2, Landsat time series and topographic data". Code snippets include 1) filtering and pre-processing ICESat-2 ATL08 canopy height segments, 2) Training and assessing accuracy of Random Forest models prediciting canopy presence and height, 3) independent validation of modeling outputs using airborne laser scanning data from LVIS.
